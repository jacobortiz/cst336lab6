        <p>
                Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known <br>
                to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, <br>
                of course, life. Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) <br>
                and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball. But, it's not perfectly round. <br>                      
                Earth is really an "oblate spheroid," because its spin causes it to be squashed at its <br>
                poles and swollen at the equator.
